Sample code creating two timeline visualizations for a presentation. License CC-BY.


I created this small repo to share code demonstrating how to use the [vistime](https://github.com/shosaco/vistime) package to create a timeline.

Sample data is from a draft survey of digital humanities projects related to local cinema histories. Data was created by Elizabeth Peterson, Michael Aronson, and Gabriele Hayden. Our first paper using this data set is under review at [Iluminace: Journal for Film Theory, History, and Aesthetics[(https://www.iluminace.cz/index.php/en/about-iluminace). Data and code are licensed CC-BY and will soon be archived through the University of Oregon's [Scholars' Bank: Data archive](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/scholarsbankdata) with a final version of the data set and more complete metadata.

This code creates a timeline showing the time period covered by a particular digital humanities project. A second timeline shows the same timeline, but broken out by the continent(s) each project covers.
